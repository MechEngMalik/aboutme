            My name is Malik Swaid, I am 28 years old, I live in Amman, I studied general mechanical engineering at the
            Polytechnic College of Al-Balqa Applied University and graduated from it in 2017, I worked in several types
            of work, including plastic factories and malls, and my last job was in Al-Mashael Contracting Company, where
            I worked for a year In building a school in the Madaba area, I did not find myself in that work and did not
            find my ambition
            My goals are to develop in a type of work that requires uniqueness in excellence, and no one can excel in it
            except with creative work, diligence and perseverance, so I found my way to programming in which I see
            myself
